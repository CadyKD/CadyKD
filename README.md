### Hello there...

This is my personal GitHub account used for such things as Java Bootcamp projects and College projects. I'll probably someday organize it into a neat little portfolio, but for now I'm rather busy completing my CompSci degree and working as a newbie software developer.

(The college projects are currently set to Private, as I have come across some from other students while doing research for my assignments and I don't want people plaigiarizing my work)
